    <h1>22 of My Favorite Memories</h1>

    <p>
        1. Going to the Comal River for the first time with you, and spending the whole day with you.
        <br><br>
        2. Our first kiss.
        <br><br>
        3. Seeing you walk the stage at graduation.
        <br><br>
        4. Celebrating your 21st, and seeing you drink legally for once.
        <br><br>
        5. Hanging out with you in "nerd lab" whenever I had "drone club" or other stuff.
        <br><br>
        6. DMing you on Instagram for the first time and getting ignored (you were playing hard to get...).
        <br><br>
        7. Joining AXO just to get to talk to you more, and seeing your face when I wrote a note to you.
        <br><br>
        8. Volunteering at Sarah's House with you.
        <br><br>
        9. Facetiming you when I was beer+vodka drunk out of my mind.
        <br><br>
        10. Every single time you go to one of my track meets I happen to PR.
        <br><br>
        11. Seeing you genuinely happy to talk about Cash and your other kiddos (but mostly Cash).
        <br><br>
        12. Seeing your face when we had those close seats at the Astros game.
        <br><br>
        13. Popping fireworks for the VERY first time with you and Gavino.
        <br><br>
        14. Every single time you have helped me move in/out of my dorm.
        <br><br>
        15. Our constant ice cream trips last summer and last school year, and your constant judgement that went with it.
        <br><br>
        16. Whenever you were in the Arkham Asylum and got mad at me for not picking up when in reality you got my number wrong.
        <br><br>
        17. Seeing your face light up when I remember those little things about you (aka that locked note I have).
        <br><br>
        18. Getting matching tattoos and me having to pretend I was in a bad mood to hide the fact that I was actually so happy and super excited to get it.
        <br><br>
        19. Stampede night outs.
        <br><br>
        20. The two hours you took to braid my hair. And then after that telling me I needed a bonnet, so we went to go buy one.
        <br><br>
        21. That one time during last summer where you stayed a few nights. That was the day I knew you were the one.
        <br><br>
        22. Easter morning...
        <br><br>
        There are so more...I'll just wait till you turn 1,000 years old so I can list them all.
