        <br><br>
        16. Whenever you were in the Arkham Asylum and got mad at me for not picking up when in reality you got my number wrong.

        <br><br>
        20. The two hours you took to braid my hair. And then after that telling me I needed a bonnet, so we went to go buy one.
        <br><br>
        21. That one time during last summer where you stayed a few nights. That was the day I knew you were the one.
        <br><br>
        22. Easter morning...
        <br><br>

	<hi>22 Things Other Love About You!</hi>
	</section>
    <section id="birthday">
	<h1>Happy Birthday Baby!</h1>

    <p>You are 22. You're literally living a Taylor Swift song right now. This is one of many gifts that I plan on showering you with today and for other birthdays
        and other special days. I just want to say that I am so proud of you and you inspire me to be the best I can be so that our future lives can be set. Never
        in a million years did I think I would have locked down a woman like you, that's so smart, so pretty, so driven, so grown, and so many other things. You've
        showed me a life I want to live with you for years to come. Cheers to you, for turning 22, (you're pushing 30...). Cheers to more late night dates, more In-n-Out dates,
        more Mario Kart competitions, more laughing together, crying together, driving together, and good times together and more firsts! 
    </p>

    <p> 
        I am lucky to say that you are mine and it makes me happy everyday that we live our lives together, growing stronger everyday. I am
        here for you in any journey and any way you need me. Happy birthday baby, I love you so much.
